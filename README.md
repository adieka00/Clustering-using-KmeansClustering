# Clustering-using-KmeansClustering
This project aims to make a clustering analysis based on data on economic and health conditions to find which countries are eligible to receive a humanitarian assistance.

In this project I did data preprocessing using pandas, data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn and lastly gathering insights from the given dataset.
